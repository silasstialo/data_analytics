# üß† Employment Suitability Prediction using Decision Tree

## üìò Overview
This project applies a **Decision Tree Classification Model** to predict whether a job applicant is suitable for employment based on features such as age, education level, work experience, and assessment scores.  

It demonstrates a full **machine learning workflow** ‚Äî from data loading and preprocessing to model building, visualization, and evaluation.

## üß© Dataset Description

Each record in the dataset represents a job applicant and contains the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `age` | Applicant‚Äôs age (in years) |
| `education_level` | Highest education attained (High School, Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, PhD) |
| `years_of_experience` | Total professional experience in years |
| `technical_test_score` | Score in technical test (out of 100) |
| `interview_score` | Score in interview (out of 10) |
| `previous_employment` | Previous job experience (Yes/No) |
| `suitable_for_employment` | Target variable (Yes/No) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded dataset using **pandas**.
- Displayed first few rows, checked datatypes, null values, and feature distributions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Replaced missing numeric values with **mean/median**.
- Replaced missing categorical values with **‚Äòunknown‚Äô**.
- Converted categorical features into numeric values using **label encoding**.
- Split data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Trained a **DecisionTreeClassifier** from `sklearn` using training data.
- Target variable: `suitable_for_employment`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Visualization
- Visualized the trained Decision Tree using `plot_tree()` from **matplotlib**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Testing and Predictions
- Predicted employment suitability for test data.
- Tested model on a few **hypothetical candidate profiles** to interpret predictions.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix** (visualized using Seaborn)
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance
- Ranked the most important features that influenced employment suitability.
